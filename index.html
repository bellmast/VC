                <li>1. How VC affects companies

				<ul>

					<li>A) Non-cash Benefits

						<ul>

							<li>1) VCs actively help their portfolio companies professionalize earlier

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/working-papers/venture-capital-professionalization-start-firms-empirical-evidence">Hellmann and Puri (2000)</a> use a unique sample of over 170 young high technology firms in Silicon Valley.  They find evidence that venture capitalists play a constructive role in helping to professionalize the organization – in the recruitment processes, the overall HR policies, the adoption of stock option plans, and the hiring of a VP of marketing and sales.  VC-backed companies are both more likely to adopt these professional practices, and to do so sooner than comparable companies without VC funding.

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

							<li>2) VC-backed companies have faster employee growth, greater sales, and faster sales growth

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0883902685900072">Bruno and Tyebjee (1985)</a> conducted 5 separate studies for this paper.  The relevant data collection effort here consisted of “Data from DandB credit reports on 145 firms; survey results for 86 firms. All firms were in high-technology SIC codes, were less than 5 years old, and located in N. California.”  Using these data, Bruno and Tyebjee found that “Ventures with outside capital achieved average sales of $4 million, sales growth 157%, and growth in number of employees of 77% compared to $8 million, 48% and 35%, respectively, in the case of companies which did not receive outside capital.”  Note that this particular aspect of their paper did not establish causality.

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

							<li>3) VC-backed companies have faster times to market

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=173655">Hellman and Puri (2000)</a> use a unique hand-collected database of Silicon Valley high-tech start-ups.  They account partially for selection and find that VC-backing is associated with faster times to market, especially for innovators (as opposed to imitators).

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

							<li>4) VC-backed companies have an increased likelihood of an IPO

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.199.5990&rep=rep1&type=pdf">Shane and Stuart (2002)</a> use data on the life histories of all 134 firms founded to exploit MIT-assigned inventions between 1980 and 1996.  They use event history analysis to determine that receiving venture funding is the single most important determinant of the likelihood of an IPO.

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

							<li>5) VC-backed companies have reduced IPO underpricing

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/2328547.pdf">Megginson and Weiss (1991)</a> use a sample of venture-backed and non-venture-backed IPOs between 1983 and 1987, matched by industry and offering size.  They find that venture capital backing results in significantly lower initial returns and gross spreads, and assert that the presence of VC lowers the total costs of going public and maximizes the net proceeds to the offering company.

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

							<li>6) VC-backed companies have greater post-IPO survival rates<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://people.hbs.edu/mbaker/cv/papers/Determinants.pdf">Baker and Gompers (2003)</a> use a sample covering 1978 to 1987, examining 1,116 firms IPOs, a third of which were venture-backed.  They find that, holding constant CEO and firm characteristics, venture capital backing reduces the probability of failure post-IPO by about 7 percent.

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

						</ul>

					</li>

					<li>B) Drivers of Impact

						<ul>

							<li>1) VCs can have a greater impact if they invest earlier

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://www.timothypollock.com/pdfs/so11.pdf">Lee, Pollock and Jin (2011)</a> developed a time-varying, multi-item composite index of VC reputation and use a sample of 438 VC-backed IPOs between 1990 and 2000. They find that early-round involvement by high-reputation VCs provides substantive benefits that aid post-IPO operating performance and investors appear to recognize these benefits, whereas late involve¬ment by high-reputation VCs appears to add little value.

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

							<li>2) VCs can have a greater impact if they are geographically close to the company

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://www.timothypollock.com/pdfs/so11.pdf">Lee, Pollock and Jin (2011)</a> developed a time-varying, multi-item composite index of VC reputation and use a sample of 438 VC-backed IPOs between 1990 and 2000. They find that when VC reputation was low the geographic distance discount was relatively small; only 0.8 percent for first-round VC reputation. However, when VC reputation was high the discount was much greater, equaling 3.4 percent. These findings further illustrate the high expectations investors have regard-ing the benefits of high-reputation VC involvement and their concerns when high-reputation VCs are not actively involved with a company.

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

						</ul>

					</li>

					<li>C) Negative Effects

						<ul>

							<li>1) VCs may pressure companies to IPO earlier than optimal

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304405X96008744">Gompers (1996)</a> uses two samples: 433 venture-backed IPOs taken public between 1978 and 1987, and a second data set that includes all IPOs for 62 venture capital funds between 1983 and 1993.  He posits and finds evidence for his grandstanding hypothesis, which predicts that young venture capital firms take companies public earlier than optimal in order to establish reputation and attract additional capital.

									</li>

									<li>ii) <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=318360">Lee and Wahal (2004)</a> use a sample of 6,238 IPOs between 1980 and 2000 from Jay Ritter, supplemented with information from the Securities Data Corporation (SDC).  They find additional evidence in support of Gompers’ grandstanding hypothesis, which predicts that younger venture capital firms take portfolio companies public earlier than older, more established venture capital firms in order to build a reputation and raise capital in the future.

									</li>

					</li>

				</ul>

			</li>





			<li>2. How VCs select companies

				<ul>

					<li>A) Important Factors

						<ul>

							<li>1) VCs consider founder preparedness to be important when evaluating proposals

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://faculty.bschool.washington.edu/skotha/scans/Passion_BP.pdf">Chen, Yao, and Kotha (2009)</a> conduct two studies, first in a controlled laboratory experiment, and then in the field at a university’s annual business plan competition.  They developed a scale to measure VCs’ perception of entrepreneurs’ passion and preparedness, and find that preparedness and not passion positively impacts the decision to fund a venture.

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

							<li>2) VCs must already have an interest in the industry

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/088390269390009T">Hall and Hofer (1993)</a> conducted semi-structured interviews with four venture capital firms, then analyzed 16 verbal protocols as the VCs screened and reviewed funding proposals.  They find that VCs have different preferences as to the kinds of investments they make and sending a business plan to a VC that does not invest in the industry is a waste of time and effort.

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

						</ul>

					</li>

					<li>B) Unimportant Factors

						<ul>

							<li>1) VCs give little weight to the entrepreneur’s passion for the company

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://faculty.bschool.washington.edu/skotha/scans/Passion_BP.pdf">Chen, Yao, and Kotha (2009)</a> conduct two studies, first in a controlled laboratory experiment, and then in the field at a university’s annual business plan competition.  They developed a scale to measure VCs’ perception of entrepreneurs’ passion and preparedness, and find that preparedness and not passion positively impacts the decision to fund a venture.

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

							<li>2) The presence of a written business plan may be necessary, but VCs give little weight to its specific informational content

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="https://www.equitynet.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Study-The-Role-of-Business-Plans-in-Venture-Capital-Decision-Making.pdf">Kirsch, Goldfarb, and Gera (2009)</a> analyze a sample of 772 funding requests submitted to a VC firm.  They find that the presence of a business planning document is weakly predictive of funding decisions, and that the actual content of the document does not inform VCs at all.  They posit that critical information about a potential portfolio company is discovered through other channels.

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

						</ul>	

					</li>

					<li>C) Social Networks

						<ul>

							<li>1) VCs have a bias toward funding entrepreneurs already in their network

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/088390269390009T">Hall and Hofer (1993)</a> conducted semi-structured interviews with four venture capital firms, then analyzed 16 verbal protocols as the VCs screened and reviewed funding proposals.  They find that, in the second stage of the assessment process, the source of the proposal matters a great deal.  Specifically, proposals previously reviewed by persons known and trusted by the venture capitalist receive a high level of interest

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

							<li>2) A trustworthy referral source can be important in evaluation

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://www.olim.org/wiki/uploads/Articles/MacMillan1985VCCriteria.pdf">MacMillan, Siegel, and Narasimha (1985)</a> first interviewed fourteen venture capitalists in the New York metropolitan area, and identified twenty-seven criteria by which these VCs evaluate venture proposals.  Using these criteria, they constructed a questionnaire and mailed out 150 copies, receiving 102 responses from VCs.  They find that it was important to the VCs’ evaluative process for the entrepreneur to have been referred by a trustworthy source.

									</li>

									<li>i) <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.199.5990&rep=rep1&type=pdf">Shane and Stuart (2002)</a> use data on the life histories of all 134 firms founded to exploit MIT-assigned inventions between 1980 and 1996.  They find that the existence of an indirect tie to a venture investor prior to firm founding very sharply increases the hazard of receiving venture financing.

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

							<li>3) Social ties help overcome information asymmetries

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/822571.pdf?acceptTC=true">Shane and Cable (2002)</a> do in-depth field-work with 50 high-technology ventures, complemented with a quantitative study of 202 seed-stage investors.  They find that both direct and indirect ties serve as mechanisms for information transfer, as opposed to reputation signaling.  Their results suggest that once information is publicly available about the quality of an entrepreneur, social ties no longer influence the investment decision.

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

						</ul>

					</li>

				</ul>

			</li>







			<li>3. How entrepreneurs attract VC

				<ul>

					<li>A) Founding Team Attributes

						<ul>

							<li>1) Previous startup experience increases the likelihood of funding and results in higher valuations

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://www-management.wharton.upenn.edu/hsu/inc/doc/papers/%5b5%5d.pdf">Hsu (2007)</a> uses data from a survey of 149 early stage technology-based startups.  He finds that  prior founding experience (especially financially successful experience) increases the likelihood of VC funding.

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

							<li>2) Previous same-industry experience increases the likelihood of funding

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.199.5990&rep=rep1&type=pdf">Shane and Stuart (2002)</a> use data on the life histories of all 134 firms founded to exploit MIT-assigned inventions between 1980 and 1996.  They find that the the rate of VC funding is increased by a factor of 2.6 for new ventures with founding teams that possess prior experience in the industry of the startup.

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

							<li>3) Higher human capital increases the likelihood of funding and results in higher valuations

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://www-management.wharton.upenn.edu/hsu/inc/doc/papers/%5b5%5d.pdf">Hsu (2007)</a> uses data from a survey of 149 early stage technology-based startups.  He finds that founding teams with a doctoral degree holder are more likely to be funded and receive higher valuations, likely due to the degree’s signaling effect.

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

						</ul>

					</li>

					<li>B) Quality Matching

						<ul>

							<li>1) Early-stage ventures will often match with similar-status VCs

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/4622352.pdf?acceptTC=true">Sorensen (2007)</a> develops a formal model and applies to a sample from the Venture Xpert database.  He restricts his sample to first investment rounds received by young companies between 1982 and 1995 – his final sample contains 75 investors and 1,666 companies.  He identifies a sorting effect whereby more experienced VCs invest in better companies

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

							<li>2) Later-stage ventures are more concerned with valuation than matching status

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://faculty.london.edu/bhallen/assets/documents/Network_Positions.pdf">Hallen (2008)</a> draws samples from potential initial and subsequent investments ties between U.S. Internet security ventures and professional investors between 200 and 2005, and supplements his data with interviews.  In his interviews, entrepreneurs said that although they often sought high-status investors in their early rounds, later they were primarily concerned with the valuation that an investor offered.

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

						</ul>

					</li>

					<li>C) Intentional Strategies

						<ul>

							<li>1) Companies can leverage their early accomplishments into further financing

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://faculty.london.edu/bhallen/assets/documents/Network_Positions.pdf">Hallen (2008)</a> draws samples from potential initial and subsequent investments ties between U.S. Internet security ventures and professional investors between 200 and 2005, and supplements his data with interviews.  His data suggest that poorly connected entrepreneurs with less human capital can benefit from focusing on attaining distinguishing accomplishments, before using those accomplishments to attract later investments.

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

						</ul>

					</li>

				</ul>

			</li>



			<li>4. Post-investment relationship

				<ul>

					<li>A) Deal structure

						<ul>

							<li>1) Staging of investments gives VCs periodic, natural exit points if a venture is underperforming

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://www.eco.sdu.edu.cn/jrtzx/uploadfile/pdf/corporatefinance/16.pdf">Gompers (2005)</a> used a data set of 794 firms that were venture-backed between 1961 and July 1992. Using regression analysis he found that the duration of financing declines for later stage companies and the average amount of financing per round generally rises. Venture capitalists may know more about later stage firms and may therefore be willing to invest more money and for longer periods of time. Venture capitalists are concerned that entrepreneurs with private information and large private benefits will not want to liquidate a project even if they have information that the project has a negative net present value for shareholders and therefore build in natural exit points.

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

							<li>2) VCs relinquish liquidation rights as the company hits performance milestones

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://leeds-faculty.colorado.edu/bhagat/vc-principals.pdf">Kaplan and Stromberg (2001)</a> conduct a study of 213 VC investments in 119 portfolio companies. They found that as a company performance improves, the entrepreneur retains/obtains more control rights. If the company performs very well, the VCs retain their cash flow rights, but relinquish most of their control and liquidation rights.

									</li>

									<li>ii) <a href="http://leeds-faculty.colorado.edu/bhagat/ContractsVentureCapital.pdf">Kaplan and Stromberg (2004)</a>  analyzed the term sheets, stock purchases, and security purchase agreements of 67 portfolio investments by 11 venture capital (VC) firms between 1996 and 1999. They found that VCs committed funding in the round is contingent on explicit financial or non-financial performance milestones. This gives VCs the right to liquidate the venture when the milestones are not met. This staging of funding is known as ex-ante and is primarily used by VCs as a way to deal with internal risk.

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

							<li>3) Board control allows the VC to intervene directly in the management of the company

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://www.people.hbs.edu/mbaker/cv/papers/Determinants.pdf">Bakers and Gompers (2003)</a> investigate the board size and composition of 1,116 firms between the years of 1978 to 1987. They find that venture capitalists substitute for instrumental and inside board members, which suggests that hey fill some of the functional roles and provide some of the value-added services that financiers, consultants, legal counsel, and other interdependent board members provide. On venture backed firm boards, the number of insiders is 27 percent smaller and 20 percent smaller for instrumental directors.

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

							<li>4) Anti-dilution provisions increase the number of shares the VC receives if the company subsequently raises money at a lower valuation

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://leeds-faculty.colorado.edu/bhagat/ContractsVentureCapital.pdf">Kaplan and Stromberg (2004)</a> analyzed 213 investments in 119 portfolio companies by 14 VC firms up to 1999.  There are two types of anti-dilution provisions that VCs use: full ratchet protection and weighted average ratchet. Full ratchet protection means that the protected security receives a claim to enough additional shares in the subsequent financing to reduce the price of the protected issue to the price of the new issue. Under the average weighted ratchet the reduction in the common stock price of the protected issue is a function of the existing shares, the new shares issued and the conversion price of the new issue. Kaplan and Stomberg find that almost 95% of the financing include anti-dilution protection and about 78% of VCs utilize the average weighted ratchet method.

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

						</ul>

					</li>

					<li>B) Altruism

						<ul>

							<li>1) Founders may act in the best interest of the venture and not themselves

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/e145/cgi-bin/spring/upload/handouts/SSRN-id843506.pdf">Wasserman (2006)</a> used regression analysis on a dataset of 1,238 surveys of executives from 528 private companies conducted from 2000-2002. He found that even after controlling for differences in formal positions and executive backgrounds, founders receive on average $25,000 less compensation than non-founders.

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

							<li>2) VCs may forgo some returns to help a venture better achieve key goals

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/4131440.pdf?acceptTC=true&jpdConfirm=true">Graebner and Eisenhardt  (2004)</a> Conducted 80, 60-90 minute, interviews with managers who sold their companies, managers who purchased companies, investors in companies that were sold, and acquisition intermediaries. They found that selling managers carefully weigh the match of combination potential and organizational rapport between the two firms, factors that are more consistent with the long-term and multifaceted calculus of courtship. Sellers, including VCs, CEOs and executives, are concerned with employee welfare, reputation, status and achievement along with price when looking for buyers.

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

						</ul>	

					</li>

					<li>C) Founder Replacement

						<ul>

							<li>1) Founder replacement most likely follows a successful investment round.

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/e145/cgi-bin/spring/upload/handouts/Founder-CEO_Succession-OrgScience.pdf">Wasserman (2003)</a> conducted 202 surveys of founders, professional CEOs, executives and investors in 202 private Internet firms that were founded between 1995 and 1999. Using a Cox event-history model he found that the longer the period of time since the last investment, the rate of succession of Founder-CEOs greatly decreases. Wasserman also found that the larger the round, the more likely that the Founder-CEOs would be succeeded. A doubling of the amount raised in the last round increases the likeliness to be succeeded by a multiple of 1.738.

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

							<li>2) Founders with more prior startup experience and/or an MBA are more likely to retain the CEO position.

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://scripts.cac.psu.edu/users/t/x/txp14/pdfs/SEJ09.pdf">Pollock, Fund, and Baker (2009)</a>  Used logistic regression on the participation of 114 VC firms in Internet sector start-ups that went public from 1995-2000. They developed a Founder-CEO human capital index, which included: previous experience in a start-up, as a CEO and whether or not the Founder-CEO possessed a MBA. They found that a one point increase in the Founder-CEO human capital index increased the retention rates by 3.276 times for Founder-CEOs in the B2B firms.

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

						</ul>

					</li>

				</ul>

			</li>



			<li>5. Differences among VCs

				<ul>

					<li>A) Experience

						<ul>

							<li>1) VC managers with previous VC experience increase exit rates.

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://www.irproje.com/userfiles/610075.pdf">Zarutskie (2010)</a> uses a regression analysis on two unique data sets, one of 222 venture capital funds from Thomson Financial/Venture Economics VentureXpert and the second, of 482 venture capitalists VentureXpert. Zarutskie finds that if a top management team has members who all have past venture investing experience the fund’s predicted exit rate increases by around 6 percent relative to a fund whose management team has no members with past venture investing experience.

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

							<li>2) VC managers with previous VC experience and experience in startups drastically increase exit rates.

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://www.irproje.com/userfiles/610075.pdf">Zarutskie (2010)</a> uses a regression analysis on two unique data sets, one of 222 venture capital funds from Thomson Financial/Venture Economics VentureXpert and the second, of 482 venture capitalists VentureXpert. Zarutskie found that if the VC fund’s members had experience as executives in start-up increases from zero to one, the fund’s exit rate increases 12 percent.

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

							<li>3) VC mangers with management consulting expertise increase their fund’s exit rates.

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://www.irproje.com/userfiles/610075.pdf">Zarutskie (2010)</a> uses a regression analysis on two unique data sets, one of 222 venture capital funds from Thomson Financial/Venture Economics VentureXpert and the second, of 482 venture capitalists VentureXpert. Zarutskie finds that an increase in the number of fund managers with past experience in consulting from zero to one increases the fund’s exit rate increases by around 10 percent.

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

							<li>4) VC managers with MBAs negatively impact a fund’s exit rates

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://www.irproje.com/userfiles/610075.pdf">Zarutskie (2010)</a> uses a regression analysis on two unique data sets, one of 222 venture capital funds from Thomson Financial/Venture Economics VentureXpert and the second, of 482 venture capitalists VentureXpert. Zarutskie finds that an increase in the number of fund managers with an MBA from zero to one decreases the fraction of portfolio companies that exit by around 5 percent.

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

						</ul>

					</li>

					<li>B) Reputation

						<ul>

							<li>1) High-reputation VCs can invest at lower valuations

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3694879">Hsu (2004)</a> does an empirical analysis of a hand-collected data set of 148 financing offers (both those accepted and declined) made to a group of 51 early-stage high-tech startups. Hsu finds that highly reputable VCs acquire startup equity at a 10-14% discount. He concludes that entrepreneurs are willing to accept a discount on the valuation of their start-up in order to access the capital of VCs with better reputations and networks.

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

							<li>2) High-status VCs use placement agents to raise capitals more often.

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/27749358">Rider (2009)</a> does empirical analyses of 1,028 venture capital funds raised by 745 firms from 2001 to 2006. Rider found that placement agents tend to represent firms with an investing track record and that higher status firms are more likely to be represented by a placement agent than are lower-status firms. Also, he found that placement agents are likely to represent firms that previously raised several funds but are less likely to represent firms that previously raised many funds.

									</li>

								</ul>

							</li>

						</ul>	

					</li>

					<li>C) Networks

						<ul>

							<li>1) A VC’s network centrality leads to higher exit rates and higher survival probability of portfolio companies.

								<ul>

									<li>i) <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/4123462">Hochberg et al. (2007)</a>  conducted a network analysis on a data set of 3,469 VC funds managed by 1,974 VC firms that participated in 47,705 investments between 1980 and 1999. Hochberg measured a VC’s network centrality by accounting for the number of VCs with which it has a relationship, the frequency with which it is invited to co-invest in other VC’s deals, its ability to generate such co-investment opportunities, its access to the best-connected VCs and its ability to act as an intermediary. He found that for VCs, a one-standard deviation increase in network centrality increases exit rates from the average 34.2% to 36.7%.  He also found that with a one-standard-deviation increase in the portfolio company’s network centrality increases the probability that portfolio companies survives to subsequent funding from 66.8% to 72.4%.

									<li>i) <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/321301">Sorenson and Stuart (2001)</a> perform an empirical analysis on a comprehensive database compromising of 1,025 VC firms and 7,590 target companies from 1986 to 1998. They find that VC firms will more likely fund a spatially distant target if they have previously co-invested with another firm that invested in the target company. Also, that VC firms will more likely fund a spatially distant target if they have previously co-invested with another firm that invested in the target company.

									<li>i) <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/323038">Podolny (2001)</a> does an empirical analysis on a data set from the Securities Data Corporation consisting of 248 VC firms and 9,853 investments between 1980 and 1996. Podolny finds that as a venture capital firm acquires a “deal-flow” network that is characterized by numerous structural holes, the firm makes a greater proportion of its investments in the earlier stages. He also finds that as the firm acquires a network that is indicative of greater status, it makes a greater proportion of its investments in the later round.
