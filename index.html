                    1. How VC affects companies
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            A) Non-cash benefits
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    1) VC-backed companies professionalize their businesses earlier than other, similar companies (e.g., by adopting HR departments, product timelines, etc.).
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <span>i) Hellmann and Puri (2000) established this fact by looking at a sample of 200 firms in the Minneapolis area.  They used semi-structured surveys and found that 90% of VC-backed firms had professionalized along these measures by month 6, as compared to 60% of similar companies using other finance.</span>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            B) Drivers of impact
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    1)   VCs can have a greater impact if they invest earlier
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <span>i) Lee et al. (2001) found this using a discontinuity regression on 200 VC backed firms, sourced from Thomson-Reuters.  While no one has yet replicated their results, their methodology is extremely sound and their conclusions compelling.</span>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    2)  VCs can have a greater impact if they are geographically close to the company
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <span>i) Lee et al. (2001) also found this in their paper, which, as above, used a discontinuity regression on 20 VC backed firms, sourced from Thomson-Reuters.  While no one has yet replicated their results, their methodology is extremely sound and their conclusions compelling</span>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            C) Negative effects
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    1)  VCs may pressure companies to IPO earlier than optimal
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <span>i) Gompers (1995) first established this fact, from a data set of 300 companies using the DandB database.  His methodology was such and such.</span>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <span>ii) (Lee and Wahal, 2004) expanded upon Gompersâ€™ earlier work and found an extra nuance.  They used another database, and a similar methodology.</span>

                                </li>
