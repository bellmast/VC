They find evidence that venture capitalists play a constructive role in helping to professionalize the organization – in the recruitment processes, the overall HR policies, the adoption of stock option plans, and the hiring of a VP of marketing and sales.  VC-backed companies are both more likely to adopt these professional practices, and to do so sooner than comparable companies without VC funding.</span>

The relevant data collection effort here consisted of “Data from DandB credit reports on 145 firms; survey results for 86 firms. All firms were in high-technology SIC codes, were less than 5 years old, and located in N. California.”  Using these data, Bruno and Tyebjee found that “Ventures with outside capital achieved average sales of $4 million, sales growth 157%, and growth in number of employees of 77% compared to $8 million, 48% and 35%, respectively, in the case of companies which did not receive outside capital.”  Note that this particular aspect of their paper did not establish causality.</span>
